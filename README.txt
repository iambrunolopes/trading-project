This my trading project! Is it supose to illustrate my progression as I learn more about C++.

The goal is to have to program compute data [Open/High/Low/Close] fed from [insert website here],
and compute all the data and answer a variety of information that I then can use for my trading analysis or
alert me about something occuring.

2019/08/02 - Got the program to ask the Open, High, Low and Close pulling functions from a non-main file;
2019/08/08 - Got the program to ask dailyRange and dailyOC (open close) from the data inputs;
2019/08/11 - The program now reads the dailyOC and says if it was a Up, Down or Zero day;

Next step: get the program to register if it was a expansion day or consolidation day!
